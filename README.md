# NumericAnnex

NumericAnnex supplements the numeric facilities provided in the Swift standard
library. It is in the earliest stages of development and not production-ready at
this time.

At present, NumericAnnex requires the latest mainline development (master)
branch of Swift because the revised numeric protocols are not yet available in
pre-release or release toolchains.
